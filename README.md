Android_Bus_Track
=================

An application that attempts to use crowdsourcing technique to determine the real-time location of public transport vehicles operating in the city of Tempe. Travellers on the bus use the app to send their location every few seconds to the server. Users waiting for the bus at their respective stops use this information to locate their transport. 

In case no real-time location is available i.e. no one on the bus is relaying the location information to our servers, we still have a schedule-based timetable which could assist the user in giving them an estimate of the time of arrival of their transport.

Uses GPS, Google Maps API, SQLite backend, Parse API.
